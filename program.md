### Workshop Schedule

- 09:10 - 09:55: **Invited Talk - Maxim Panov**
  - **Title**: Uncertainty Quantification for Generative Language Models
  - **Abstract**: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has made ML-based applications even more vulnerable to risks of causing various forms of harm to users. For example, models often “hallucinate”, i.e., fabricate facts without providing users an apparent means to validate their statements. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods could be used to detect unreliable generations unlocking the safer and more responsible use of LLMs in practice. UQ methods for generative LLMs are a subject of cutting-edge research, which is currently quite scarce and scattered. We systemize these efforts, discuss common caveats, and provide suggestions for the development of novel techniques in this area.

  - **Title**: Reasoning under Uncertainty with Large Multimodal Language Models
  - **Abstract**: Uncertainty in intelligent models has multiple facets. One aspect concerns a model’s own uncertainty or confidence in its generated outputs. Another pertains to factual knowledge about uncertainty within specific concepts. For example, statements such as “10–20% of lifelong smokers will develop lung cancer” express factual uncertainty derived from statistical data analyses and represented in text. A key research question is whether language models can form and convey such factual uncertainties—integrating information, drawing on their internal knowledge, and aligning this with their confidence when expressing opinions. While addressing this question is highly challenging, I will present our research that explores related directions and the following research question: 1) How do language models understand uncertainty expressions in natural language and perform probabilistic inference over them? 2) How can models be trained to follow the principles of probabilistic reasoning when handling uncertainty in text? 3) How can today’s large models reason over uncertain text? specifically focusing on mapping language into formal probabilistic logic programs?, and finally, in the context of grounding natural language in the visual modality, 4) How can uncertainty in perception be explicitly represented in reasoning? specifically focusing on mappings to differentiable probabilistic programs.

  - **Title**: Beyond Factuality: Improving Trust and Reliablility of Large Language Models
  - **Abstract**: Factuality is a cornerstone for trustworthy LLMs, yet despite impressive progress, frontier LLMs still make many confident errors when faced with questions beyond their knowledge boundaries. In this talk I'll present Faithful Response Uncertainty, a different desiderata that shifts the focus away from measuring the number of incorrect statements and towards measuring the alignment between the model's expressed certainty ("decisiveness") and intrinsic certainty ("confidence"). I'll conclude with a discussion of open problems and possible next steps at the intersection of factuality and uncertainty in frontier LLMs.
- 15:30 - 16:00: **Coffee Break**
- 16:00 - 16:45: **Invited Talk - Eyke Hüllermeier**
  - **Title**: Challenges in Uncertainty Quantification for Large Language Models
  - **Abstract**: Uncertainty quantification is important in the context of large language models (LLMs) because the outputs produced by these models are often incorrect. However, due to the complexity of language and the numerous sources of uncertainty in textual data, quantifying uncertainty in LLMs is challenging. Indeed, simply transferring existing approaches to uncertainty quantification developed for standard machine learning problems, such as classification and regression, is neither straightforward nor appropriate. This is particularly pertinent to the definition of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, and how they are distinguished based on the notion of reducibility. This talk will discuss the challenges of uncertainty quantification for LLMs, propose potential solutions and highlight promising avenues for future research in this emerging field.
