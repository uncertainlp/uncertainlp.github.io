<!-- # First Workshop on Uncertainty-Aware NLP @EACL 2024 -->
Welcome to the website of the **UncertaiNLP** workshop to be held at [EACL 2024 in Malta](https://2024.eacl.org/).

*Tagline:* UncertaiNLP brings together researchers embracing sources of uncertainty from human language and NLP tools; harnessing them for improved NLP.

## Important Dates
- ~~**First call for papers:** October 20, 2023~~
- ~~**Second call for papers:** November 15, 2023~~
- ~~**Third call for papers:** December 11 , 2023~~
- ~~**Submission deadline:** December 22, 2023~~
- **Submission of already pre-reviewed ARR papers:** January 17, 2024
- **Notification of acceptance:** January 20, 2024
- **Camera-ready papers due:** January 30 2024
- **Workshop date:** March 21 or 22, 2024

All deadlines are 11:59pm UTC-12 ("anywhere on earth").

## Workshop Topic and Content

Human languages are inherently ambiguous and understanding language input is subject to interpretation and complex contextual dependencies. Nevertheless, the main body of research in NLP is still based on the 
assumption that ambiguities and other types of underspecification can and have to be re-solved. This workshop will provide a platform for research that embraces variability in human language and aims to 
represent and evaluate the uncertainty that arises from it, and from modeling tools themselves.

### Workshop Topics

UncertaiNLP welcomes submissions to topics related (but not limited) to:

- *Frameworks for uncertainty representation*
  - Theoretical work on probability and its generalizations
  - Symbolic representations of uncertainty
- *Documenting sources of uncertainty*
  - Theoretical underpinnings of linguistic sources of variation
  - Data collection (e.g., to to document linguistic variability, multiple perspectives, etc.)
 
- *Modeling*
  - Explicit representation of model uncertainty (e.g., parameter and/or hypothesis uncertainty, Bayesian NNs in NLU/NLG, verbalised uncertainty, feature density, external calibration modules)
  - Disentangled representation of different sources of uncertainty (e.g., hierarchical models, prompting)
  - Reducing uncertainty due to additional context (e.g., additional context, clarification questions, retrieval/API augmented models)

- *Learning (or parameter estimation)*
  - Learning from single and/or multiple references
  - Gradient estimation in latent variable models
 
- *Probabilistic inference*
  - Theoretical and applied work on approximate inference (e.g., variational inference, Langevin dynamics)
  - Unbiased and asymptotically unbiased sampling algorithms
 
- *Decision making*
  - Utility-aware decoders and controllable generation
  - Selective prediction
  - Active learning
    
- *Evaluation*
  - Statistical evaluation of language models
  - Calibration to interpretable notions of uncertainty (e.g., calibration error, conformal prediction)
  - Evaluation of epistemic uncertainty

**Kristin Lennox** has more than ten years of experience applying statistics, machine learning, and operations research techniques to scientific and engineering problems. Her expertise includes experimental design, analysis of computer experiments, and risk assessment in high consequence environments. Kristin Lennox's career has included data science applications in aerospace, automotive engineering, chemical engineering, materials science, process engineering, oil and gas, public infrastructure, bioinformatics, software development, and manufacturing. She has worked with many varieties of data ranging from large publicly available datasets to small scale designed experiments and specializes in combining disparate data types and sources to solve complex problems. Dr. Lennox's recent professional experience has focused on design of artificial intelligence (AI) systems intended to act in partnership with people. Since joining Exponent, she has been studying safety benefits of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving.

**Mohit Bansal** is the John R. & Louise S. Parker Professor and the Director of the MURGe-Lab (UNC-NLP Group) in the Computer Science department at University of North Carolina (UNC) Chapel Hill. Prior to this, he was a research assistant professor (3-year endowed position) at TTI-Chicago. He received his PhD from UC Berkeley in 2013 (where he was advised by Dan Klein) and his BTech from IIT Kanpur in 2008. His research expertise is in natural language processing and multimodal machine learning, with a particular focus on grounded and embodied semantics, language generation and Q&A/dialogue, and interpretable and generalizable deep learning. He is a recipient of IIT Kanpur Young Alumnus Award,  DARPA Director's Fellowship, NSF CAREER Award, Google Focused Research Award, Microsoft Investigator Fellowship, Army Young Investigator Award (YIP), DARPA Young Faculty Award (YFA), and outstanding paper awards at ACL, CVPR, EACL, COLING, and CoNLL. He has been a keynote speaker for the AACL 2023 and INLG 2022 conferences. His service includes ACL Executive Committee, ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award Committee, CoNLL Program Co-Chair, ACL Americas Sponsorship Co-Chair, and Associate/Action Editor for TACL, CL, IEEE/ACM TASLP, and CSL journals.

## Call for Papers
~~Authors are invited to submit by December 18, 2023 original and unpublished research papers in the following categories:~~

- ~~Full papers (up to 8 pages) for substantial contributions.~~
- ~~Short papers (up to 4 pages) for ongoing or preliminary work.~~

~~All submissions must be in PDF format, submitted electronically via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=eacl.org/EACL/2024/Workshop/UncertaiNLP) and should follow the EACL 2024 formatting guidelines (following the [ARR CfP](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp): use the official ACL style templates, which are available [here](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files)).~~

We now accept submissions with already existing ACL Rolling Reviews (ARR) via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=eacl.org/EACL/2024/Workshop/UncertaiNLP_ARR_Commitment), with the deadline January 18 AoE. These submissions must have been reviewed by ARR before, which will be used in our evaluation, and which must be linked to our system through the **paper link** field available in the OpenReview form. Please make sure to also follow the EACL 2024 formatting guidelines (following the [ARR CfP](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp): use the official ACL style templates, which are available [here](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files)).

We also invite authors of papers accepted to Findings to reach out to the organizing committee of UncertaiNLP to present their papers at the workshop, if in line with the topics described above.

Camera-ready versions for accepted archival papers should be uploaded to the submission system by the camera-ready deadline. Authors may use up to one (1) additional page to address reviewer comments.

Call for Papers is available [here]({% link cfp.md %}).
