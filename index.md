## Workshop Topic and Content

Human languages are inherently ambiguous and understanding language input is subject to interpretation and complex contextual dependencies. Nevertheless, the main body of research in NLP is still based on the 
assumption that ambiguities and other types of underspecification can and have to be re-solved. This workshop will provide a platform for research that embraces variability in human language and aims to 
represent and evaluate the uncertainty that arises from it, and from modeling tools themselves.

### Workshop Topics

UncertaiNLP welcomes submissions to topics related (but not limited) to:

- *Frameworks for uncertainty representation*
  - Theoretical work on probability and its generalizations
  - Symbolic representations of uncertainty
- *Documenting sources of uncertainty*
  - Theoretical underpinnings of linguistic sources of variation
  - Data collection (e.g., to to document linguistic variability, multiple perspectives, etc.)
 
- *Modeling*
  - Explicit representation of model uncertainty (e.g., parameter and/or hypothesis uncertainty, Bayesian NNs in NLU/NLG, verbalised uncertainty, feature density, external calibration modules)
  - Disentangled representation of different sources of uncertainty (e.g., hierarchical models, prompting)
  - Reducing uncertainty due to additional context (e.g., additional context, clarification questions, retrieval/API augmented models)

- *Learning (or parameter estimation)*
  - Learning from single and/or multiple references
  - Gradient estimation in latent variable models
 
- *Probabilistic inference*
  - Theoretical and applied work on approximate inference (e.g., variational inference, Langevin dynamics)
  - Unbiased and asymptotically unbiased sampling algorithms
 
- *Decision making*
  - Utility-aware decoders and controllable generation
  - Selective prediction
  - Active learning
    
- *Evaluation*
  - Statistical evaluation of language models
  - Calibration to interpretable notions of uncertainty (e.g., calibration error, conformal prediction)
  - Evaluation of epistemic uncertainty

**Kristin Lennox** is a consultant at Exponent with more than ten years of experience applying statistics, machine learning, and operations research techniques to scientific and engineering problems. Dr. Lennox received her Ph.D. in statistics from Texas A&M University in 2010. She then joined Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where she cofounded and served as the first director of their internal statistical consulting service. After leaving the laboratory she spent several years in the software industry with a focus on AI in industrial settings, and she currently serves as a consultant regarding statistics and AI implementation for applications in many areas, including environmental science, automotive and consumer product risk, and software. Her expertise includes experimental design, analysis of computer experiments, and risk assessment in high consequence environments. Dr. Lennox’s recent professional experience has focused on methods to characterize safety benefits of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving. Dr. Lennox is passionate about statistics and AI education and has created a series of videos for technical and lay audiences on these topics.

<!-- **Mohit Bansal** is the John R. & Louise S. Parker Professor and the Director of the MURGe-Lab (UNC-NLP Group) in the Computer Science department at University of North Carolina (UNC) Chapel Hill. Prior to this, he was a research assistant professor (3-year endowed position) at TTI-Chicago. He received his PhD from UC Berkeley in 2013 (where he was advised by Dan Klein) and his BTech from IIT Kanpur in 2008. His research expertise is in natural language processing and multimodal machine learning, with a particular focus on grounded and embodied semantics, language generation and Q&A/dialogue, and interpretable and generalizable deep learning.

**Clara Meister** is a PhD student in Computer Science with Prof. Ryan Cotterell at ETH Zürich, supported by a Google PhD Fellowship. She is passionate about the general application of statistics and information theory to natural language processing. A large portion of her research in the last years has been on natural language generation—specifically, on decoding methods for probabilistic models. Her additional interests within the field of natural language generation include evaluation metrics and the incorporation of uncertainty into decoding methods.

**Chrysoula (Chryssa) Zerva** is an Assistant Professor in Artificial Intelligence at the Instituto Superior Tecnico in Lisbon, Portugal. She is also a member of LUMLIS, the Lisbon ELLIS unit. She obtained her Ph.D. in 2019 from the University of Manchester working on “Automated identification of textual uncertainty” under the supervision of Prof. Sophia Ananiadou. She was subsequently awarded the EPSRC doctoral prize fellowship to study (mis)information propagation in health and science. 
In 2021, she joined the Instituto de Telecomunicações in Lisbon as a post-doc for the DeepSPIN project under the supervision of Prof. André Martins and worked on a range of machine learning and NLP related topics including uncertainty quantification, machine translation and quality estimation.
Beyond core research, she is interested in dissemination of science to the public and keen on promoting women's participation in research and science; she has previously presented in or co-organised events such as the Pint of Science, Women in Localisation and Greek Girls Code.
